# media.z

Base functionality for me would be:
- multiuser support
- transcoding and chunk streaming
- progress tracking
Eventually I'd add support to get episode names and descriptions etc.

The webapp would be reasonably basic, likely just polymer base elements to start.

Hopefully it doesn't just stay as talk and I actually get it done!
